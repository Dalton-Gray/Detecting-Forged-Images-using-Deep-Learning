## Detecting Forged Images using Deep Learning


### Overview
In recent years creating high quality forged images has become trivially easy and there are numerous ways in which this technology could be used maliciously. The goal of this project is to investigate the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in detecting these forgeries.

### Dependencies
I reccomend to use the provided environment.yml file, but the dependencies for the entire project are:

  - python=3.6
  - flask
  - tensorflow=1.13
  - keras
  - pillow
  - requests

### Project Structure
1. Baseline Implementation
	* test
2. Application Programming Interface (API)
